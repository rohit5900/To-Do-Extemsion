# TODO List for UI Enhancements to Glass Todo Extension

- [x] Update popup.html: Add checkboxes for each task and replace text icons with SVG icons for add and delete buttons.
- [x] Update styles.css: Add animations (fade-in for new tasks, hover effects), improve glass effects (increased blur, better shadows), and add styles for completed tasks (strike-through, reduced opacity).
- [x] Update popup.js: Modify render function to include checkboxes, handle checkbox changes to mark tasks as completed/incomplete, and update Chrome storage accordingly.
- [x] Test the extension in the browser to ensure functionality works correctly.
- [x] Confirm with user for any additional tweaks or feedback.
